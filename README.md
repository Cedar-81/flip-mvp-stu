## Flip Classroom Students

Everything is similar to the teachers view link here -> https://github.com/Cedar-81/flipmvptextteachers

### Here are a few differences

In the teachers view only if you have a class code from a teacher can you join the class by going to the same icon to select class from teachers view(https://github.com/Cedar-81/flipmvptextteachers) to add a class

After you have added a class you can access the notes shared by that teacher in the bookshelf

Without adding a class you can create personal notes very similar to the instruction in the teacher view(https://github.com/Cedar-81/flipmvptextteachers) readme

You can edit your profile from from the settings button.

### Note
Currently the image upload feature isn't working so updated notes wouldn't be updated

### Have fun
